# Exp.No:26  
## Method Overriding

---

### AIM  
To write a Python program to create a Parent class `Bird` and inherit two child classes `Sparrow` and `Ostrich` from the `Bird` class with the same method `flight()`. Create an object for each class and call the methods of the class which will print the name of the bird that is flying.

---

### ALGORITHM

1. **Begin the program.**
2. **Define the Bird class**:
   - Create a method `intro()` to print "There are many types of birds."
   - Create a method `flight()` to print "Most of the birds can fly but some cannot."
3. **Define the Sparrow class**, which inherits from `Bird`:
   - Override the `flight()` method.
   - Call the `intro()` method from the parent class.
   - Print "Sparrows can fly."
4. **Define the Ostrich class**, which inherits from `Bird`:
   - Override the `flight()` method.
   - Call the `intro()` method from the parent class.
   - Print "Ostriches cannot fly."
5. **Create an object `obj_bird`** of the `Bird` class.
6. **Create an object `obj_spr`** of the `Sparrow` class.
7. **Create an object `obj_ost`** of the `Ostrich` class.
8. **Print the general message** "There are many types of birds."
9. **Call the `flight()` method** on each object (`obj_bird`, `obj_spr`, `obj_ost`) to display the respective messages.
10. **Terminate the program.**

### PROGRAM

```


class Bird:
    def intro(self):
        print("There are many types of birds.")

    def flight(self):
        print("Most of the birds can fly but some cannot.")

class Sparrow(Bird):
    def flight(self):
        self.intro()
        print("Sparrows can fly.")

class Ostrich(Bird):
    def flight(self):
        self.intro()
        print("Ostriches cannot fly.")

obj_bird = Bird()
obj_spr = Sparrow()
obj_ost = Ostrich()

obj_bird.intro()
obj_bird.flight()

obj_spr.flight()
obj_ost.flight()


```

### RESULT
Thus, the python program to create a Parent class Bird and inherit two child classes Sparrow and Ostrich from the Bird class with the same method flight(). Create an object for each class and call the methods of the class which will print the name of the bird that is flying has been executed and verified successfully.
